This project contains 4 parts: 
- P1: Search
- P2 Multi-Agent Search
- P3 Reinforcement Learning
- P4 BNs and HMMs: Ghostbusters


#### 1 Search

- Complete all 8 questions.
- Total score: 26/25.

#### 2 Multi-Agent Search

- Implement several adversarial search algorithms such as Minimax,  Expectimax, Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning, etc.
- Complete all 5 questions.
- Total score: 25/25.

#### 3 Reinforcement Learning

- Implement several algorithms related to MDPs(Value iteration, policy extraction), reinforcement learning(Q-Learning, Q-Learning with approximation function), etc.
- Complete all questions except question 5: prioritized sweeping value iteration.
- Total score: 22/25 (3 points loss for question 5).

#### 4 Tracking
